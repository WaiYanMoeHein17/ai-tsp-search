Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Python. The algorithms include basic and enhanced versions. 

Files:
particle_swarm_optimisation_basic.py: A basic implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for TSP.
particle_swarm_optimisation_enhanced.py: An enhanced version of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for TSP.

city_files: A directory containing sample city files used as input for the algorithms.

How to use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
3. Run the desired algorithm script with a city file as input. For example:
   python particle_swarm_optimisation_basic.py city_files/sample_city.txt
4. The output will be a text file containing the tour and its length.
5. Modify the user information in the script files as needed.
